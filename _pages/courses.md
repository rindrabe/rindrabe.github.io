## CS 105 Digital Media Computing
Digital media processing forms a basic block in technologies underlying today’s successful media, social, and publishing companies. This course covers various techniques for the creation and manipulation of multimedia, including pictures, sounds, texts, and movies. Students learn the concepts and skills of object-oriented programming by designing and implementing a series of digital effects. **Java(Processing)**
 CS 150 Data Structure and Algorithms
This course continues the development of object oriented approaches to the design and implementation of software systems. Students will learn to analyze problems, algorithms and develop object-oriented solutions to problems. Students will also learn to use multiple data structures and the accompanying algorithms to store, index and retrieve data. **Java**
## CS 200 Computers and Society
This course examines the computer’s cultural context: the managerial, political, legal, ethical, psychological, and philosophical implications of computing. **Writing**
 CS 202 Analysis of Algorithms
The design and analysis of algorithms and their complexity. This course studies techniques for measuring algorithm complexity, fundamental algorithms and data structures, intractable problems, and algorithm-design techniques.
## CS 203 Computer Organization
A study of digital logic, computer components, internal and external memory, instruction sets, interrupts, micro- and macro-programming. **C** and **Java**
## CS 205 Software Engineering
The analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance strategies appropriate for large software projects. **C++(Qt)**, **HTML** and **MySQL**
## CS 320 Database Management System
This course examines the organization, design, and implementation of database management systems. **PostgreSQL**, **Caspio** and **R**
## CS 417 Data Mining(Pending)
## ECON 251 INTERMEDIATE MICROECONOMICS
A study of how individuals and organizations deal with the problem of scarcity, the role of prices in coordinating economic activity, criteria for determining desirable allocation of resources, the mix of private and public institutions, and the economic basis of public policies.
## ECON 252 INTERMEDIATE MACROECONOMICS
An examination of aggregate economic activity focusing on the forces that determine the behavior of real GDP, interest rates, and the price level. Economic growth, fluctuations, unemployment, and inflation are analyzed along with alternative policies for dealing with them.
## ECON 365 ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS
Econometric analysis is a blend of mathematics, statistics, and economic theory. It focuses on the development of multiple regression models useful for testing economic relationships and making business forecasts. The multiple regression model and problems encountered in its application are developed in lecture and individual applied research papers. Topics include serial correlation, heteroscedasticity, simultaneous equations, limited dependent variable models.
## INDS 171: Lafayette Initiative for Malagasy Education(LIME)
This course has two objectives. First, you will learn about the education system of a developing country, and will explore the role of education in development broadly defined.  Moreover, you will quickly encounter the constraints that a country like Madagascar faces, especially in terms of improving post-basic educational outcomes.  This will prepare you for the second objective which is to participate in a peer-to-peer mentoring program with promising young high school students from Madagascar. The idea is to prepare the Malagasy students for the process of applying to colleges in the United States.  As products of a different education system, bright Malagasy students are at a disadvantage when they apply to high-quality post-secondary institutions in the United States like Lafayette
## MATH 272 - Linear Algebra with Applications
An introductory course in linear algebra emphasizing applications to fields such as economics, natural sciences, computer science, statistics, and engineering. The course covers solutions of systems of equations, matrix algebra, vector spaces, linear transformations, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
## MATH 282 - Techniques of Mathematical Modeling(Pending)
A course that introduces students to the fundamentals of mathematical modeling through the formulation, analysis, and testing of mathematical models in a variety of areas. Modeling techniques covered include proportionality, curve fitting, elementary linear programming, and simulation.
## MATH 335 - Probability
A development of basic probability theory including the axioms, random variables, expected value, the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Additional topics include distribution functions and generating functions.
## MATH 336 - Mathematical Statistics
A mathematical development of fundamental results and techniques in statistics. Topics include estimation, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression.
## MATH 347 - Financial Mathematics
A wide range of topics in mathematical finance are covered, including: continuous time models such as the Brownian motion model for stock prices, the Black-Scholes model for options prices, the Ho-Lee, Vasicek and other models for interest rates, also different hedging strategies and numerical approaches for derivative pricing such as binomial trees, Monte-Carlo simulation and finite difference methods, and price models for credit derivatives such as asset swaps, credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations.
## MUSIC 104: Music Technology 1
This course explores the use of computers to compose music in a digital format through sequencing and sampling software. The basics of melody, rhythm, and harmony will be examined as they relate to computer-assisted music composition. Weekly assignments engage students in exploring specific techniques and features of digital audio software. The final capstone project involves utilizing all skills developed in the course to compose a multi-track musical composition in a variety of audio file formats
